**PMF**: Probability of getting exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials
$$\Pr(X=k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$

*Observations*:
- With $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures, their joint probability is given by: $p^{k} (1-p)^{k}$
- The number of ways it can happen: ${n \choose k}$
