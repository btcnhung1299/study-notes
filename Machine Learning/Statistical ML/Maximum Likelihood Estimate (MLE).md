Similar to [[Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)]], Maximum Likelihood Estimate ignores the denominator introduced in general flow of [[Bayesian Learning]]. The method concerns the likelihood part in the numerator
$$\hat{\theta} = \arg \max_\theta f(x | \theta)$$
or equivalently,
$$\hat{\theta} = \arg \max_\theta \log f(x | \theta)$$
