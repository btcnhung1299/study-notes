#### Description
We want to plan our policy $\pi$ such that it is optimal in the environment, which we have no information about the [[Markov Decision Process]] behind it. At the same time, the optimal policy must satisfy the Bellman Optimality Equation (see [[Bellman equation]]).

#### Approaches
1. [[Monte-Carlo Policy Iteration]]
2. [[Temporal-Difference (TD)]]
