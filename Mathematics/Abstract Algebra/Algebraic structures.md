## Group
A group is a set with **a binary operation** that has associativity, identity and inverse element

## Field
A field is a group with **two binary operations** (usually called addition and multiplication) where under each operation, the field is an [[Abelian (communitative) group]] and the two operations are related via distributive law, e.g. $a(b+c) = ab + ac$.

Example: $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{C}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ are fundamental fields.

**Field extension**: given a pair of fields $E \subseteq F$ where operations of $E$ is restricted under $F$'s. $F$ is called extension field of $E$ and $E$ is subfield of $F$. For example, $\mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$. One can create new field out of the old one via defined procedure.
