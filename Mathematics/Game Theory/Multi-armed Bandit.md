In words, one-armed bandit is a single-handle (slot) machine that try to "steal" money from lose gamer. The $N$-armed bandit (or multi-armed bandit) refers to the problem in which a player must decide which machine to play, how many times of playing and in which oder. In general, multi-armed bandit is a scheduling problem in which we have to allocate resources to multiple choices such that it maximises our gain.

It is complex because there exists different reward distribution at each machine and our objective is to maximises the sum of rewards earned through a sequence of playing.

The problem is popular for analysing the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. Specifically, an agent tries to learn about the unknown distribution through exploration while attempting to maximise its reward by exploitation.
