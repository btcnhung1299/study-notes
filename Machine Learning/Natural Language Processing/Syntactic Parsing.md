**Goal**: analyse a sentence by identifying its constitutes to model their syntatic relation

**Syntax/parse tree**:
- Node types: root, branch, leaf
	- *Non-terminal*: either root or branch
	- *Terminal*: leaf
- Different types of syntax tree: constitutency-based, dependency-based, etc.

**Context-Free Grammar**: apply pre-defined rules to parse constitutes without considering the actual context of a sentence
- Use syntax tree to represent the constitutes
