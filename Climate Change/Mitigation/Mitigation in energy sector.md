## Energy definition
In energy sector, [[Greenhouse Gases (GHG)]] emission is defined via **Kaya identity**
$$F = P \times \frac{G}{P} \times \frac{E}{G} \times \frac{F}{E} \tag{1}$$
where
- $P$: global population
- $G$: world GDP per capita, which is proxy for services consumed
- $E$: global energy consumption
- $F$: global $\mathrm{CO_2}$ emission

Despite most of the terms will cancel out, Kaya identity helps us compute emissions from available, factored elements.

## Approaches
To mitigate consumed energy, we can reduce any term in Equation (1) (in the way that does not negatively impact other terms).

For example in car transportation, we can do mitigation by:
1. Reduce $\frac{G}{P}$, or service per population via:
	- Reduce service $G$ = reduce the demand of transportation (e.g. by moving closer to your workplace)
	- Increase population $P$ = increase number of passengers per vehicle (e.g. by commuting on public transports with others)
2. Reduce $\frac{E}{G}$, or energy per service via:
	- Change to more efficient vehicle or efficient driving routes
3. Reduce $\frac{F}{E}$, or GHG emissions per energy
	- Change from fossil fuels to alternative fuels (e.g. battery electric, electro fuels, hydrogen)
