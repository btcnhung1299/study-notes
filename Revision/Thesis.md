*Q: Describe your thesis*
A: My thesis investigates how to increase personalization in [[Federated Learning]] with emoji prediction as a use-case. In particular, we look at ways to adapt the aggregated parameteres for each client such that local models can give personalized predictions regarding the users' emoji patterns. We approach this problem as finding the most flexible parameters and employ model-agnostic meta-learning where each client correponds to a task to solve. However, as target clients (mobile users in our use case) are typically heterogenous in the sense of computing resources, we integrate this idea of personalized federated learning with weight shrinking to make the algorithm more computation-effient.
