A group (which includes a set $A$ and an operation $\circ$) is abelian if the operation applied on any two group members is communicative.

An abelian group satisfies four axioms: associtivity, commutativity, having identity and inverse element (see [[Binary operation properties (communicative, associative, identiy, inverse)]]).
