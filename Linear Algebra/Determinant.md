**Definition**: Recursively defined as


**Intuition**: Measure how much scale does the area changed (by the absolute value) and the orientation (the sign) in the transformation, which is done by multiplying with the matrix

**Special event:** the matrix with determinant is 0 will squish a current dimension to the smaller dimension (because the area after transformation is 0, or it vanishes). Equivalently,
- The columns are linearly independent
