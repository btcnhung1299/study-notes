**Intuition**:
A prior probability is the probability *prior* to observations.

Example: The probability of head $p$ when one flips a coin:
- You can assume the coin is fair and $p = 0.5$
- You can conduct thousands of experiments to get the approximating probability
=> The first option is prior probability because your assessment of probability takes place *before* you done anything with the coin.
