Prisoner's dilemma is an experiment that is frequently analysed in game theory.

## Background
Two criminals A and B are arrested. They are required to answer questions in different rooms. There are four situations, each will result in different charges for the criminals:
- If A and B betray each other, each will serve two years in prison
- If A betrays B and B remains silent, B will serve three years in prison and A will be set free
- If B betrays A and A remains silent, A will serve three years in prison and B will set free
- If A and B both remain silent, A and B will serve one year in prison

## Property
The game highlights the misalignment between individual good and common good. Individually, A or B can obtain optimal reward if one of them successfully betrays the another; whereas the overall optimal reward can only be obtained when both remains silent.

The game employs partial observations in which each 'rational' agent taking into account the response of other agents to act optimally.

The game can be repeated for many times, resulted in **iterated prisoner's dilemman**. Strategies in this version can change over time: a criminal can remain silent more if the implictit cooporation formed between the two and otherwise.
