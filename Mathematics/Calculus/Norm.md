Norm is a function that maps a point in a vector space to a real value $p: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $X$ is the vector space. Intuitively, norm of a vector can be seen as distance from it to the origin. It is actually a distance function because it satisfies triangle equality, be non-negative and is zero only the origin. 

The $p$-norm of a vector $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ is defined as
$$\lVert x \rVert_p := \left( \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^p \right)^{1/p}$$
