Advantage function measures how much better a specific action $a$ in state $s$ (measured by [[action-value function (Q-function)]]) over the average when actions are randomly selected according to the policy $\pi$ (measured by [[state-value function (utility)]])
$$A_{\pi}(s,a) = Q_{\pi}(s,a) - V_{\pi}(s)$$
