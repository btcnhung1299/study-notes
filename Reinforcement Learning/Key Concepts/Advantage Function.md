Advantage function measures how much better a specific action $a$ in state $s$ (measured by [[Action-value Function, or Q-function]]) over the average when actions are randomly selected according to the policy $\pi$ (measured by [[State-value Function, or Utility]])
$$A_{\pi}(s,a) = Q_{\pi}(s,a) - V_{\pi}(s)$$
