A cooperative game regards to the collaboration between coalition. At the beginning, a coalition of parties collaborate and then get an amount of payoff. Concretely, a cooperative game is usually defined as a function $v$ with $v(C)$ denotes the sum values/payoffs all the parties in $C$ can get on their own.

The interations among parties are analysed in the [[Cooperative game theory (CGT)]].
