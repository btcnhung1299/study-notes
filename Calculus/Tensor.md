Tensor rank 1 is a vector.

Tensor is invariant/fixed but the components of tensor can change due to the change in the coordination system. This change can be **contravariant** or **covariant**. A vector with corresponding transformed components are thereby named contravariant vectors and covariant vectors.
- If the basic vector and the component transform in an opposite manner, then the vector is contravariant. This vector is specified with superscripts (e.g. $a^1$)
- Otherwise, it is covariant. This vector is specified with subscripts (e.g. $a_1$)
