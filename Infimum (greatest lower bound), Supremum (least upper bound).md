Given set $S$ of a partially ordered set $P$:
- An infimum (greatest lower bound) of the set $S$ is the largest value in $P$ that is less than or equal to any values in $S$ (if such element exists).
- An supremum (least upper bound) of the set $S$ is the smallest value in $P$ that is greater than or equal to any values in $S$ (if such elemnt exists).
