**Purpose**: Demonstrate that immediate reward is more preferable than future reward

**Application**: Typically included in **infinite-horizon** [[return]]:
$$\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t \tag{1}$$
where $r_t = R(s_t, a_t)$ is a reward.

**Mathmatical property**:
- Force equation (1) to be converged to a finite value.
