Monte Carlo method uses importance sampling to reduce variance. Particularly, the proposal distribution is selected such that "impotant" samples, i.e. the samples that have more impact on the estimated parameters, are more likely to occur.

To correct the biased estimated by the use of important sampling, Monte Carlo method weights the simulation outputs with the likelihood ratio.
