Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) measures the difference between two distributions $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{D}'$ based on their differences of their expected function values. Concretely,
$$\text{MMD}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D}, \mathcal{D}') := \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}}(\mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}}[f(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{x' \sim \mathcal{D}'}[f(x')])$$
(note that $\sup$ refers to "supremum", meaning the largest)
