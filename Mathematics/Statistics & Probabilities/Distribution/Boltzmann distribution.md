The Boltzmann distribution measures the probability of the system being in specific state $x$ as
$$p(x) \propto \exp(\frac{\epsilon(x)}{kT})$$
where
- $\epsilon(x)$ is the enery of state $x$ given by the energy function $\epsilon$
- $k$  is Boltzmann's constant
- $T$ is thermodynamic temperature

The Boltzmann distribution is often used as sampling distribution in Boltzmann machine.
