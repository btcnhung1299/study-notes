1. Injection (one-to-one):
	$$\forall x, x^\prime \in X, x \neq x^\prime \implies f(x) \neq f(x^\prime)$$ 
2. Surjection (onto, many-to-one):
	$$\forall y \in Y, \exists x \in X, y = f(x)$$
3. Bijection: reserve both injection and surjection. In other words, bijections are functions that have inverse.
	$$\forall y \in Y, \exists !x \in X, y = f(x)$$
	where $\exists !x$ means "there exists exactly one $x$"
