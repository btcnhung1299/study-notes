Advantage function measures how much better a specific action $a$ in state $s$ (or action-[[value function]]) compared to the average (expectation) when actions are randomly selected according to the [[policy]] $\pi$ (measured by state-[[value function]])
$$A_{\pi}(s,a) = Q_{\pi}(s,a) - V_{\pi}(s)$$
