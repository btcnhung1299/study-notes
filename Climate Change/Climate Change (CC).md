With weather being short-term variations and climate being a (long-term) expected pattern, climate change (CC) is the change in climate overtime.

**Note**: [[Global Warming]] is only one sign of CC.

## Causes
Positive [[Radiative Forcing]], i.e. the domination of the amount of coming in compared to out energy on Earth, is the main cause of CC.

## Effect

## Approaches
- Mitigation: reduce [[Greenhouse Gases (GHG)]] emission in different sectors (e.g. [[Mitigation in energy sector]], transportations)
- Adaptation: characterise the risks and increase resillence to the consequences of CC via climate prediction, reducing societal impacts, to name a few
- Overarching framework: policy, markets, individual action, education, finance, etc.
