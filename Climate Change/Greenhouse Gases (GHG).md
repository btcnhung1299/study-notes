Greenhouse Gases (GHG) are the common name for gases that emit or absorb infraded thermal radiation. GHG is transparent to solar energy but it traps them under the surface, which leads to positive [[Radiative Forcing]].

## GHG types
There are different GHG:
- 95\% are water vapor
- Other notable types: carbon dioxide ($\mathrm{CO_2}$), nitrous oxide ($\mathrm{N_2O}$), methane ($\mathrm{CH_4}$). They are often addressed because of its [[Global Warming Potential (GWP)]] because they efficiently trap heat and stay for a long time.

The GWP of GHG is often expressed in $\mathrm{CO_2}$ equivalent ($\mathrm{CO_2-eq}$) with $\mathrm{CO_2}$ unit. For example, $\mathrm{CO_2-eq}$ of $\mathrm{N_2O}$ is 25 means that 1M tonnes of $\mathrm{N_2O}$ has the same GWP as 25M tonnes of $\mathrm{CO_2}$.

## Origins
The fact that GHG comes from different sectors (figure below), nevertheless, leaves room for many impactful innovations in different places.
