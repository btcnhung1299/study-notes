There are four useful properties of binary operation: communicative, associative, identity, and inverse.

Let $\circ$ denote an arbitrary binary operation. Then $\forall a, b \in A$:
1. Communicative: $a \circ b = b \circ a$
2. Associative: $a \circ (b \circ c) = (a \circ b) \circ c$
3. Identity: an element $e \in A$ is identity for $\circ$ operation if $e \circ a = a \circ e = a$
4. Inverse: if $\circ$ has an identity $e$, an inverse for $a$ is $b$ if $a \circ b = b \circ a = e$
