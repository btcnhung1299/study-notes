Measure space is a 3-element tuple $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ where
- $X$ is a set
- $\mathcal{A}$ is a [[Sigma-algebra]] that defines subsets (and their orders) of set $X$
- $\mu$ is a [[Measure]] that defines values (as measure of volumn/size) of subsets defined by sigma-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ from the set $X$.

**Probability space** is a measure space with $\mu$ is a probability measure.
