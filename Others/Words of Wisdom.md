"... the language that is used is a careful compromise between fully colloquial English which would indeed run the risk of being unacceptably imprecise, and fully formal symbolism, which would be a nightmare to read. The ideal is to write in as friendly and approachable a way as possible, while making sure that the reader (who, one assumes, has plenty of experience and training in how to read mathematics) can see easily how one writes could be made more more formal if it became important to do so."
