1. Most of the time, I find it rather obscure to think that more depth and more parameters would help the model achieve better performance. Frequently, it is claimed to get the model more "expressive". Recently, I encounter a way to put it into a clearer intuition. Basically, we want the model to be flexible enough so that they can actually speak for themselves based on the observed data. In other words, we don't want to put too much assumptions on the model. There are two main ways to achieve this flexibility:
	- Large number of parameters (compared to the data set)
	- Be non-parametric
