Cauchy distribution, Lorentz distribution, or Cauchy-Lorentz distribution has
- PDF: $\frac{1}{\pi \gamma \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{x-x_0}{y}\right)^2 \right]}$
In physics, it is the distribution of x-intercept of a ray issuing from $(x_0, y)$ where $x_0$ is location parameter, $\gamma$ is the scale parameter.

**Mean in Cachy distribution**
Cauchy distribution doesn't exist because as we taking integral
$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) \, dx$ using two one-sided [[Improper integral]], both sides are infinite.
