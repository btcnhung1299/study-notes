State in RL refers to the state of the environment the agent is lived in.

**Note**: The environment can changed on its own, or by the actions the agent take [0].

**Terminology**:
- When the agent can see a complete observation, or state, it is said to be **fully-observed**, whereas **partially-observed** means the agent can get only a glimpse of the state.

*Q: Are state and observation interchangable?*
A: No. State is all information about the world, wheras some information can be omitted in an obsevation, or a partial description.
