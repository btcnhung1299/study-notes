Radiative/Climate forcing is the change in the amount of energy in versus out of the Earth, which are came from
- Incoming energy: from solar, aka insolation (~ 340 $\mathrm{W/m^2}$)
- Outgoing energy: reflection of solar energy (~100 $\mathrm{W/m^2}$), thermal emission (~239 $\mathrm{W/m^2}$), etc

**Positive radiative forcing** refers to the situation in which the Earth receives more energy than it radiates to space, gives rise to global warming. The issue is caused mostly by the heat trapped by [[Greenhouse Gases (GHG)]].
